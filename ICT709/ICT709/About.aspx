    <h3>Student-Corporate Portal.</h3>
    <p>To bring the students and corporates together, we aim to develop a website with the help of sponsorship from the corporate world. The single most important objective of this website would be to allow the corporate to post about the various opportunities for students on a temporary basis. At the same time, the students would be able to view these opportunities and express their interest in working on the requirements as listed by the corporates. These aspects would provide a direct interface between the corporates and the students. To ensure that only applicable candidates are able to view and apply for the opportunities, the access to the website shall be restricted to university campus..</p>
